# What is this

My first React Native project during the Technigo bootcamp.
Assignment: **Build a mobile application using React Native**.

## How I started

I watched the videos from this week and also a few extra on youtube. After I had done the weekly lab in snack and had everything npm/expo-related installed I started. I really enjoyed that we got to choose what to do this week and I decided to make an app that fetched a random beer from an API and displayed som information about it.

### What I struggled with and should improve for next weeks project

I didn't really struggle with anything major this week just minor things. Such as combining border-radius and border on a gif when the border-radius is different in different corners. I also couldn't manage to show my Lottie-animation on snack so I just added a gif there and have the Lottie-solution in my repo on git.

### What I'm proud of

I mean... Everything! I made a mobile app! I'm proud that I figured out how to use haptics, alerts and making links open in safari. I think the styling is nice as well. I've done so many things in this project that I'm really proud of. Every part of it has been great fun.

## If I had more time

If I had more time I would, and will probably during the weekend, fix the android styling because it's not perfect on the start screen. I would also change the setup a bit and use react navigation rather than ternary operators as I have done now to switch between views. The code isn't bad in any way but it would be nice to learn how to do it with navigation setup.
